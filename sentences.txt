The shore is composed of a belt of smooth rounded white stones like paving-stones, excepting one or two short sand beaches, and is so steep that in many places a single leap will carry you into water over your head; and were it not for its remarkable transparency, that would be the last to be seen of its bottom till it rose on the opposite side.

Jackson lingered in the shower; bracing his hands on the wall, letting the water run on the back of his neck.

After enjoying a leisurely lunch at a restaurant on the water, they walked barefoot on the beach holding hands.
2

1


Maybe we should get her some water.
2

1


Then you had some water, a few steaks, then held court with Sarah and Connor.
2

1


Frozen water pipes and unheated bedrooms had to be something new for a wealthy socialite.
2

1


She turned on the faucet, plunging her hands under the icy stream of water and gasped.
2

1


Inside the barn, Carmen filled two buckets with warm water and heaved them out of the sink.
2

1


Taking mincing steps so that the water wouldn't slosh out of the buckets, she worked her way toward the barn door.
2

1


Some day she was going to pipe water into the barn.
2

1


Two occupied stalls and he couldn't figure out where to put the water.
2

1


I was just trying to make sure he put the water in the correct stalls.
2

1


The only sound was the sucking sound their boots made in the mud and the soothing sound of flowing water down at the creek.
2

1


The chickens fought for position in the tiny coop door as they watched her pour a bucket of water into the tire.
2

1


Pushing each other aside, they buried their beaks in the water and lifted their heads, eyeing her suspiciously as the water trickled down their throats.
2

1


Then they sneezed and shook the cold water from their waddles and drank again.
2

1


The sound of running water from the bathroom proclaimed that Katie was taking a shower.
2

1


Alex had broken the ice off the top of the water trough by the time she got there and every stall was filled with fresh hay.
1

0


She heaved a warm bucket of water from the sink and suppressed a smile as she met his concerned gaze.
1

0


She held the gate as he carried the bucket of water into the stall.
1

0


She sloshed through the slushy snow, splashing icy water on the legs of her jeans.
1

0


No doubt Tessa was in labor and searching for a private place to give birth - some place high in the rocks, away from the water, but sheltered from the wind.
1

0


Carmen managed to get Tessa into a stall, and then hobbled to the dairy for some warm water.
1

0


You get Tessa some warm water.
1

0


The best thing she could do now was soak in some warm bath water, but there wasn't time.
1

0


At that moment, the bobber plunged under the surface of the water.
1

0


His words were like a dash of cold water.
2

1


They found a place on the side of the bridge and stared down at the water as it roared over the spillway.
2

1


I think I forgot to turn the water off when I filled the trough.
2

1


We carry our own water and testing equipment.
3

2


It will tide them over while they try to repair their water system.
2

1


The road edged a thatch of forest past the water treatment plant and the power plant, and circled the central command hub in which she worked before leading to the main entrance of the compound.
2

1


Keep my men with food and water, and I'll marry you if our paths ever cross, he said.
2

1


There was no running water, no food supplies, no energy whatsoever, just a deteriorating building with a score of insurgents and a small black box.
2

1


He stepped through to a massive atrium with a marble floor, pillars, and water fountain surrounded by small gardens.
2

1


Light, water, you have food, too?
2

1


She sipped from a container of water and turned again to the wall behind the titanium glass, unable to pinpoint how one of the sensitive keypads had made it outside the compound or when.
2

1


No supplies, no water, no food, hundreds of thousands of refugees trying to survive on nothing.
2

1


Elise pursed her lips, and Lana was surprised to see her eyes water.
2

1


She touched the small vault containing the Horsemen in her cargo pants and sipped water.
2

1


She took a shower, as hot as it would go, and stayed until the hot water ran out.
2

1


Brady pulled out his water bottle as he listened.
2

1


Cold water soaked Lana's boots as Dan kept them on the creek's edge for a few hundred meters before veering into the surrounding forest.
2

1


Lana was in the kitchenette, drinking water after her day with Elise.
2

1


The cabin swayed, and Lana caught the image of wires and far below, water.
2

1


They were going into the black water, hundreds of feet beneath them.
2

1


She was ready to break down crying and throw herself out of the helo in the hopes she didn't die when she hit the water.
2

1


Once it hit water, it would inflate, and the water-breather would activate.
2

1


Lana fumbled with her harness and yanked it free, slogging through the rising water.
2

1


She struggled to pull herself out of the cabin, against the flow of cold river water.
2

1


She couldn't stand, not with her frozen body, and she rolled onto her back, out of the water.
2

1


As long as you have water, you only need to eat once a day.
2

1


She chewed her lip as she watched the micro map multiple routes, gauging how much food and water she'd have to carry to survive.
2

1


The terror on Lana's face was fresh in his thoughts, and he heard her scream again as he was flung from the helo, before it hit the water.
2

1


Four-story buildings had been built to the ceiling, flanking a narrow pathway and canal of water, siphoned from the Mississippi.
2

1


The metal lair was much cooler than the air above ground, and water stained the walls on one side of the tunnel.
2

1


Jim closed the door, and Lana watched the submarine sink quietly into the surrounding water and disappear.
2

1


Gabriel handed her the food and water gummy cubes she'd first had in Hell.
2

1


The idea of emeralds swimming around in a lake was too much for Katie.  She felt nauseous again at her overwhelming situation and stopped, leaning against a tree.  What she would give for a sip of real water!
2

1


She pushed herself up, reaching into a pocket for a food and water cube.  Gabriel took her arm and pulled her to her feet.  She nearly choked on the cubes and swallowed them whole, struggling to keep up with the death-dealer as he darted into the forest.
2

1


The water looked … black in the moonlight.  She took a step back and looked up towards the moons.  As Gabriel indicated, one moon was lower than the other.
2

1


Gabriel glanced at her and straightened.  He handed her more food and water cubes then motioned for her to seat herself by the fire.
2

1


She was drenched to the skin and rivulets of water ran down her shivering body.
2

1


Cynthia was as limp as a rag doll as he pulled down her skirt, which was heavy with water.
2

1


The sound of running water in the next room told Dean that daylight had finally arrived and Cynthia Byrne was up and around.
2

1


The bullet hole hadn't been visible at first due to Wassermann's long hair, the condition of the body, and the length of time in the water.
2

1


Memories beckoned from the creek so she pulled off her shoes, rolled up her pants legs and waded in the cool water for a while.
2

1


He threw the last stone into the water without trying to skip it.
2

1


The water came to her chest.

They soon mixed a tub of oatmeal with a little water, and Jim ate it with much relish.

8


And say the net cost to society of having a gallon of polluted water dumped into the river—the cleanup cost, or the economic impact of the gallon of dirty water—is $10.
3

2


As the cool stream gushed over one hand she spelled into the other the word water, first slowly, then rapidly.

8


Every morning after breakfast I prepared his bath, made his cage clean and sweet, filled his cups with fresh seed and water from the well-house, and hung a spray of chickweed in his swing.
3

2


The buoyant motion of the water filled me with an exquisite, quivering joy.
9

8


The word coming so close upon the sensation of cold water rushing over her hand seemed to startle her.
5

4


But she was surprised that hot water should come out of the ground.
3

2


Boat did glide swiftly and I put hand in water and felt it flowing.
12

11


His highest duty to fodder and water his horses!

7


When my floor was dirty, I rose early, and, setting all my furniture out of doors on the grass, bed and bedstead making but one budget, dashed water on the floor, and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it, and then with a broom scrubbed it clean and white; and by the time the villagers had broken their fast the morning sun had dried my house sufficiently to allow me to move in again, and my meditations were almost uninterupted.
3

2


Yet a single glass of its water held up to the light is as colorless as an equal quantity of air.
3

2


Ice has its grain as well as wood, and when a cake begins to rot or "comb," that is, assume the appearance of honeycomb, whatever may be its position, the air cells are at right angles with what was the water surface.
2

1


Still the cannon balls continued regularly to whistle and flop onto the ice and into the water and oftenest of all among the crowd that covered the dam, the pond, and the bank.
11

10


He tried several times to join in the conversation, but his remarks were tossed aside each time like a cork thrown out of the water, and he could not jest with them.
4

3


Still laughing and talking, the officers began hurriedly getting ready and again boiled some muddy water in the samovar.
2

1


That curly grass which always grows by country roadsides became clearly visible, still wet with the night's rain; the drooping branches of the birches, also wet, swayed in the wind and flung down bright drops of water to one side.
2

1


The doctors were of use to Natasha because they kissed and rubbed her bump, assuring her that it would soon pass if only the coachman went to the chemist's in the Arbat and got a powder and some pills in a pretty box for a ruble and seventy kopeks, and if she took those powders in boiled water at intervals of precisely two hours, neither more nor less.
3

2


He longed to get into that water, however dirty it might be, and he glanced round at the pool from whence came sounds of shrieks and laughter.
2

1


Along this part of the coast are some of the best areas for water sports, bike riding, leisurely walking and shopping.

The sound of water running in her bathroom brought her up short.

The water stopped running, but he didn't come out of the bathroom immediately.

She was running water into the skillet to let it soak when Alex came up behind her.
0

0


His antics caused her to drop the skillet, splashing gravy and water on her shirt.

She grabbed a towel and daubed water and gravy from her shirt and the counter top.

She quickly put the plates in the dishwasher and dumped the stale water from the frying pan.

She filled a plastic bowl with water for the chickens and hauled buckets of water to the horses and buffalo.
0

0


She heated some water and carried a towel back to the bathroom to bathe before bed.
0

0


She turned the fire off and poured a little water into the cast-iron skillet to keep it from sticking.
0

0


Maybe the warmth of the water would help her relax before they talked.

0


Below they could hear water running over stones in the creek.

Carmen gave the horses some grain and went to feed and water the chickens.

The sun had melted a thin layer of water over the ice in the water trough.

She took a rock and broke the ice, reaching in the frigid water with her fingers to pull out the jagged pieces of ice.

After they ordered dinner, he pondered over his water glass.

He strode to the door, leaving a trail of water.

She mopped up the water and sat down on the window seat.

The stones were sunk in the sand now, covered by a couple inches of water.
0

The icy water tickled her toes as it leaped over her feet and danced around the rocks.
0

She nodded and poured some water into a cup.
0

0


After she finished dishes, she watered the chickens and added water to the horse tank.
0

0


All right, but don't be surprised if I panic now and then and try to scramble out of the water — or even pull you under with me.
0

0


She cleaned up the blood first then took a fast enough shower that the water didn't have time to warm from cold to hot.
0

0


He took a hot shower to soothe the muscle aches and stood in the hot water, letting it run over him.

Jenn splashed water on her face and brushed her teeth quickly.

When he didn't return immediately, her gaze fell to the warm bowl of water.

She returned to the couch and dipped her hands in the water.

I must keep our alliances strong by delivering the water from the Springs!

0


Only because I know the Spring water you carry is worth a hundred lives.
0

0


He wants the water from the Springs, which he claims is magic.
0

0


The bladder of water from the Springs was lost in the fight with Memon's men.
0

0


She pushed herself away from the door and crossed to a small pitcher of water and basin in the corner.
0

0


Her hands shook as she drank water.
0

0


I give water from the Springs to every king my father wronged.

She ignored his question and turned away, moving to a small basin of water.
0

0


The roads were muddy, and the first of several wells she saw teemed with dirty water.

He traced his fingers along the barrel's rough surface before dipping his hand into the water.

Cold water slowed his feet and sent shivers through him.

The water moved silently over moss and lichen covered slabs of rocks, forming small pools in the low spots.

Their heads jerked up, water dripping from their muzzles as they looked around, their ears perked forward searching for any sound that might indicate danger.
0

It was close to water but high enough to escape floods.

She carried the water to Princess and then crossed the tack room to the other section of the barn.

Buffalo are a different species – like the water buffalo.

That was when the water works started.

They rode the narrow trail up the side of the mountain single file and stopped at the spring to rest and water the horses.

Aaron and Rob helped her unsaddle the horses and get them into stalls with hay and water.

They all removed their shoes and socks and rolled up their pants legs before wading into the cold water.
0

The water was so cold that it made the rocks seem sharper.

Carmen woke to the feel of water pounding on her legs.
0

0


A few minutes later he leaned back over the bluff and dropped a bottle of water into Alex's waiting hands.
0

0


It crossed her mind that she couldn't get dehydrated in this rain, but she obediently downed some of the water.
0

0


Grabbing a wash cloth, she moistened it with cold water.
0

0


She put the last of the dishes in the dishwasher and ran water in the sink to wash the iron skillet and wooden handled spatula.
0

0


Probably some run down shack without electricity or running water - and how much of the 40 acres was vertical?
0

0


Drawing water from a well and cooking on a wood stove would be inconvenient, but how complicated could it be?
0

0


Far below, green water moved sluggishly around huge gray boulders.
0

0


She turned on the faucet and a stream of discolored water splashed into the sink.
0

0


Gradually the water became clear and she twisted the knob until the water flow stopped.
0

0


The water's cool and refreshing - just the thing after a hot day of work.
0

0


They don't come out into the water very often when people are swimming.
0

0


How can you swim in that water when you know snakes might be lurking under the surface?
0

0


More than likely they'll be swimming on top of the water in plain sight.
0

0


You can tell the poisonous ones because they lift their heads out of the water while they swim.
0

0


Yeah, but near the water you mostly see copperheads and water moccasins.
0

0


Most of the snakes in the water are harmless.
0

0


Rushing to the bathroom, she stripped and showered, washing the bugs off with soap and hot water.
0

0


The rocks were deceptively sharp and the coldness of the water increased the sensitivity of the soles of her feet.
0

0


Unwilling to go on, she stopped and hugged herself, watching Keaton plunge into the water.
0

0


His dripping frame emerged from the water and he strode toward her as if the bottom of the creek were sand.
0

0


He scooped her into his arms and started for the deeper water.
0

0


With that he dumped her into the water.
0

0


The icy water robbed her of breath and she came up sputtering and treading water.
0

0


She pulled her hair back from her face and wiped the water from her eyes.
0

0


I thought you said you could swim - or is that only in salt water?
0

0


He cupped his hand and dashed water into her face.
0

0


She gasped and rubbed the water from her eyes again.
0

0


He flipped water at her again and she turned away, swimming strongly for the bluff on the other side of the creek.
0

0


She was getting used to the water and it felt good, but she would have preferred a swim in the ocean.
0

0


She ducked under the water and swam a short distance before surfacing to make sure she wasn't close to any rocks.
0

0


As she wiped the water from her eyes, something bumped her shoulder.
0

0


She slapped water at it, and screamed again when she felt a sharp pain in her hand.
0

0


She scrambled behind Keaton, still splashing water at the dark form that followed her wake.
0

0


In fact, he reached out and plucked the stick from the water.
0

0


She staggered back and her foot slipped on a smooth stone, spilling her into the water again.
0

0


Scrambling to her feet again, she stumbled to shallow water.
0

0


The burning in her eyes had little to do with the creek water, and after such a cowardly display, she didn't want him to catch her crying.
0

0


Her stomach was still tied in knots, and she clutched her knees to her chest, shivering in the cold creek water.
0

0


Water splashed as Keaton strode toward her and strong hands gripped her arms, lifting her to her feet.
0

0


She splashed cool water over her face and washed the sleep from her body.

The water bill was going to be outrageous.
0

He unfolded his arms and tossed some coffee into the boiling water.
0

0


He slid the frying pan into the sink and ran water into it.

0


Placing some eggs into a saucepan she ran enough water to cover them and placed them over a fire on the stove.

I need to check the water in my radiator before we leave.

Huge bluffs ruptured from the ground and oozed with water.

A glass of water would taste good right now.

0


He lowered her feet to the ground and she limped toward the sound of water.
0

0


How stupid not to bring water along on a hike.
0

0


Justin leaned across the pool and cupped a hand under the stream of water.
0

0


The water smelled so delicious - sounded so soothing.
0

0


A slight breeze tossed a spray of water in the air, cooling it immediately.
0

0


He flipped some water at her.
0

0


How do you know your well water isn't polluted?
0

0


She dodged the spray of water.
0

0


Did you think you had city water clear out here?
0

0


He laughed and drank another handful of water.
0

0


The water was cold and had a metallic taste she liked.
0

0


She jerked away from him, reaching for more water.
0

0


She splashed some more of the cool water on her face and neck.
0

0


Cut a few trails, clear around the pool of water - maybe enlarge it and get some ducks.
0

0


She drank some more of the water.
0

0


Do you suppose there are any pesticides in this water.
